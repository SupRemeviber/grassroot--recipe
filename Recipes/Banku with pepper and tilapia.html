<p>Ingredients</p>

  -Corn dough 
  -Cassava dough 
  -Tilapia

  -Onion
  -Salt
  -oil 
  -Flour

<p>Preparation</p>

  <p><u>#Banku</p></u>

•Filter the cassava dough with a colander  enough water in a pot to separate from husk and then you mix with the corn dough, add  in 1/2 tsp of salt for every cup of dough you use.

<p>•Place the pot on the stove at medium heat and mix with a wooden spatula (Banku Ta) continuously. As the mixture  thicken and comes together.

Now you will drive the Banku with you spatula for about 5 minutes. You can a video on YouTube to learn how to drive Banku @how to drive Banku</p>

<p>•Now pour water into the dough, and about 1/4 cup of water to the pot or enough water as a result to make it soft and cover the pot and let the banku cook for about 10 minutes at medium heat. This is what will actually cook the banku and will change the texture and colour. If you double or triple the banku dough, let it cook for up to 15 minutes. The banku will go from white to a translucent white and it will become a lot less grainy.

After, remove the cover and continue to drive the banku for another five minutes till the banku is really nice and smooth.</p>

<p>•Now, scope the Banku into your bowl</p>

  <p><u>#Pepper</p></up>

<p>Wash your earthenware pot or Blender including your pepper,onions. Blend or grind the pepper and onions for a fine texture.

  Now,grease pot with a little oil and pour the mixture into the pot. Cook for about 5 to 10 minutes and your pepper is ready.</p>

<p><u>#Tilapia</p></u>

<p>Pour oil into pot and put on fire. wash your tilapia with water,vinegar and salt. Pour stock away when finished, now check whether the oil is hot. If so sprinkle a little flour into tr oil to avoid the tilapia from tearing.

  Fry the tilapia for about 10 to 20 minutes and that's all.</p>

<p>Hope it is not stressful</p>
