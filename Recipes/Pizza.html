<p>ingredients</p>

  -1 cup all purpose flour
  -4 tablespoon processed cheese
  -Tomato ketchup
  -2 mushroom(optional can use sausages or meat)
  -1 tomato
  -1/4 capsicum (green pepper)
  -1/2 teaspoon oregano
  -1 onion
  -1/2 teaspoon chilli flakes
  -1/4 cup mozzarella
  -1/2 teaspoon baking powder
  -1/2 tablespoon dry yeast
  -1/2 teaspoon sugar

<p><b>Preparation</p></b>

<p>Take a dough kneading plate and add all-purpose flour to it. Add baking powder and salt in it and sieve the flour. Make a hole in the centre and add 1 teaspoon of oil to it. On the other hand, boil a little warm water and mix with the yeast in it along with 1 teaspoon of sugar. Mix well and keep aside for 10-15 minutes. If the yeast rise, add it to the flour and  knead the dough nicely using some water. Keep this dough aside for 4-6 hours. Then knead the dough once again. Now, the pizza dough is ready.</p>

<p>Preheat the oven.Now, is the time to make the pizza base when the dough is ready. Sprinkle dry flour on a table and take a large amount of the pizza dough. Using a rolling pin, roll this dough into a nice circular base. Once you have made the base, use a fork and prick the base with it so that the base doesn't rise and gets baked nicely. Put it into the preheated oven and bake it 10 minutes. Now, your pizza base is ready.</p>

<p>Now, wash the capsicum and slice it thinly in a bowl. Then, peel the onions and cut thin slices of it as well in another bowl as well  as the tomatoes or the mushroom. Make sure that those tomatoes have less juice in them. Once you have finished cutting the vegetables. Now, grate the processed and mozzarella cheese in separate bowls.</p>

<p>Then, take the fresh pizza base and apply tomato ketchup all over. Spread half the processed cheese all over the base and evenly put the veggies and mushrooms(beef or sausage)across the base. Once you have put all the veggies, put a thick layer of mozzarella cheese.</p>

<p>Preheat the oven for five minutes at 250 degrees Celsius and put the pizza base in a baking tray and place it inside the oven.Bake the Pizza for 10 minutes at 250 degree Celsius. Once done, take out the baking tray and slice the pizza. Sprinkle oregano and chilli flakes and serve hot with chilled drink</p>
